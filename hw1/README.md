# Setup

Note: Please be sure you have Python installed on your system. The following instructions should work on Mac or Linux. If you have any trouble getting set up, please come to office hours and the TAs will be happy to help.

You can complete this assignment in a virtual environment or locally.

### To set up a Conda environment: 
You might want to create a virtual environment for the project. If you choose not to use a virtual environment, it is up to you to make sure that all dependencies for the code are installed on your machine. To set up a virtual environment, run the following:

	cd starter_code
	conda create -n hw1 python=3.11
	conda activate hw1
	pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install dependencies

Once you have completed this assignment, you could exit the virtual environment using the following command line:

	conda deactivate         # Exit the conda environment

### others
You could use any method you are familiar with to set up the environment, as long as you can run .ipynb files in the environment. See dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
